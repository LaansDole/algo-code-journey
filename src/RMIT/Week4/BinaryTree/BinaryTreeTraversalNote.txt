Suppose we want to perform pre-order traversal on this tree. Here's how the traversal would proceed:

1. Visit the root node (5) and print its value: 5
2. Traverse the left subtree in pre-order:
    1. Visit the root node (3) and print its value: 3
    2. Traverse the left subtree in pre-order:
        1. Visit the root node (2) and print its value: 2
        2. The node has no children, so return to its parent.
    3. Traverse the right subtree in pre-order:
        1. Visit the root node (4) and print its value: 4
        2. The node has no children, so return to its parent.
3. Traverse the right subtree in pre-order:
    1. Visit the root node (8) and print its value: 8
    2. Traverse the left subtree in pre-order:
        1. Visit the root node (7) and print its value: 7
        2. The node has no children, so return to its parent.
    3. Traverse the right subtree in pre-order:
        1. Visit the root node (9) and print its value: 9
        2. The node has no children, so return to its parent.

So the pre-order traversal of the tree would result in the following output: 5 3 2 4 8 7 9

Now, let's perform in-order traversal on the same tree. Here's how the traversal would proceed:

1. Traverse the left subtree in in-order:
    1. Visit the root node (2) and print its value: 2
    2. The node has no children, so return to its parent.
2. Visit the root node (3) and print its value: 3
3. Traverse the right subtree in in-order:
    1. Visit the root node (4) and print its value: 4
    2. The node has no children, so return to its parent.
4. Visit the root node (5) and print its value: 5
5. Traverse the left subtree in in-order:
    1. Visit the root node (7) and print its value: 7
    2. The node has no children, so return to its parent.
6. Visit the root node (8) and print its value: 8
7. Traverse the right subtree in in-order:
    1. Visit the root node (9) and print its value: 9
    2. The node has no children, so return to its parent.

So the in-order traversal of the tree would result in the following output: 2 3 4 5 7 8 9
